This repository provides the code and the data used in the paper **Mining exceptional closed patterns in attributed graphs** [1]. This work is an extension and an improvement of the paper [2]. It is organized as follows :
- **Algorithms**: This folder contains the algorithm implementations of the approaches defined in the paper. For each approach, we provide the code and the release.
- **Data**: This folder contains the real world data and the synthetic graph generator used in the experiments.

All the source codes are implemented in Java.
